# [AOC](https://advent-of-code.com/) helper

## Input files

`aoc-helper` will automatically try to download the input file if it is not present in `input/{year}/{day}.txt`.
For this, you need the environment variable `AOC_SESSION_ID` to be set to the `sessionid` cookie you
can find in your browser's storage.
